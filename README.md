# Multi-Class Classification Using Logistic Regression
Authored by saeed asle
# Description
This project implements multi-class classification using logistic regression with a one-vs-all approach.
It uses the sigmoid activation function and gradient descent for optimization.
The dataset used for this project consists of features (X) and labels (y) for each example.
The project includes the following steps:
* Sigmoid Function: Defines the sigmoid function to map any real value into the range [0, 1].
* Cost Function: Defines the cost function to measure the accuracy of the model's predictions.
* Gradient Function: Defines the gradient function to calculate the gradient of the cost function.
* Gradient Descent: Implements gradient descent to minimize the cost function and optimize the model's parameters.
* One-vs-All Classification: Implements one-vs-all classification to handle multi-class classification problems.
* Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance on both the training and test sets using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
